# Microtransaction Login Page

## About the project

Microtransaction Login Page is a tech demo for MTX INC, a mock company set on bringing the joys of microtransations to the login experience. MTX INC offers users 5 free starter "characters" (abcde) and the opportunity to experience the joy of collecting 21 unique characters. MTX INC supports fair trade and generously offers a 2-for-1 special combo which unlocks uppercase AND lowercase variants with the purchase of any character.

Register a mock company to feel the glory of an MTX-enhanced user login/signup experience!
